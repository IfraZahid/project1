          <h2>History of Quaid-e-Azam</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah[a] (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 - 11 September 1948)
              was a barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of
              the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947,
              and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.
              Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's
              Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court,
              and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.
              Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the
              20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hinduâ€“Muslim
              unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League,
              in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule
              League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of
              Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
              follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
